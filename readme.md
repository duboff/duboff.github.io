# Mikhail Dubov

After spending over 3 years in investment banking and several months at a start-up I have decided to make a switch to software development where as it turns out my passion truly lies. I have just graduated from Makers Academy, an intensive bootcamp-type program in London focused on Ruby but I am keen to learn a lot more. I am now looking for a full time coding position at an awesome company in London.   


## Sample Open Source Projects

It uses WebRTC for in-browser cross-device voice recording, Rails for the server side and a lot of AngularJS for the client side. [web](https://in-your-own-words.herokuapp.com)|

## Experience

### [Alphasights](http://www.alphasights.com/) - Software Engineer

**July 2014 - Present**

Full-stack development with a focus on the Company’s main app, an internal project management system used by analysts to find advisors, create and manage projects and communicate to the client.
* Working mostly with a large Ruby on Rails application with Javascript and Coffescript parts. Within the system I focused first on the search features (working with SOLR) and then on compliance features. This work allowed to learn the Rails API much deeper working in tandem with an amazing team of developers.
* One of my projects was a greenfield app that is used by the team to send updates on what other members are working on (using Github and Flowdock APIs).
* All project work is done in an Agile way with weekly iteration planning, Trello boards and constant pairing with Senior and more Junior developers.
* I was also lucky enough to be able to invest time in acquiring new skills such as EmberJS, ReactJS and Go. While I have not yet written production code in these, I plan to work more with these new technologies to become a more well-rounded developer.

## Keen to learn
I am very aware I am only in the beginning of my coding adventure and there is a lot more to learn. Here is a wish-list of things I would like to understand better (or at all in some cases). This is an incomplete, unordered list and I do realise it may take quite a long time:

* Dynamic frameworks: Node.js + Express, Flask, Django
* Functional languages: Clojure or Erlang
* Statically typed languages: Scala, C# or Go
* Front-end frameworks: Angular.js or Ember.js
* NoSQL: MongoDB, Redis
* Programming for mobile devices: Swift or at least Phone Gap / Ruby Motion
