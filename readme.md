# Mikhail Dubov

After spending over 3 years in investment banking I have decided I was not enjoying my job as much I would have liked. At the same time I had a lot of business ideas which were not compatible with banking. I first joined a startup and found that I thrive a lot more in that environment. I fell in love with coding doing online courses and decided to take it further at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). 

I am now looking for a full time coding position at an awesome company in London.
